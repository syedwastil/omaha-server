- **Compliance**: Adhere to relevant data protection laws and regulations.
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all software dependencies up to date to mitigate security risks.

### 4.4. Maintainability

- **Code Quality**: Write clean, well-documented code following best practices.
- **Modularity**: Structure the application to allow for easy updates and additions.
- **Testing**: Implement unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.

## 5. Technical Requirements

### 5.1. Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x
- **Web Framework**: Django (latest stable version)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MySQL (depending on preference)
- **Web Server**: Nginx or Apache with uWSGI or Gunicorn
- **SSL/TLS**: Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates
- **Additional Libraries**:
  - **lxml**: For XML parsing and generation
  - **requests**: For handling HTTP requests (if needed)
  - **Django Rest Framework**: Optional, if RESTful APIs are to be provided

### 5.2. Deployment Environment

- **Operating System**: Linux (Ubuntu or CentOS recommended)
- **Containerization**: Docker (optional, for easier deployment)
- **Virtualization**: Support for deployment on virtual machines or cloud instances

### 5.3. Client Compatibility

- **Protocols**: Support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols, with a preference for HTTPS.
- **XML Schema**: Conform to the Omaha XML schema for requests and responses.

## 6. Project Deliverables

- **Source Code**: Complete Django project with all source files.
- **Documentation**:
  - **Installation Guide**: Steps to set up the development and production environments.
  - **API Documentation**: Details of endpoints, request formats, and response formats.
  - **User Guide**: Instructions for using the administrative interface.
- **Test Cases**: Unit and integration tests covering critical functionality.
- **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts or instructions for deploying the application to a server.

## 7. Development Plan

### 7.1. Phase 1: Setup and Configuration

- **Initialize Django Project**: Set up the project structure and configuration.
- **Database Setup**: Configure the database and create initial schemas.
- **SSL Configuration**: Install and configure SSL certificates.

### 7.2. Phase 2: Implement Core Functionality

- **Omaha Protocol Handling**: Develop views to handle update requests and event reporting.
- **XML Parsing and Generation**: Implement functions to parse incoming XML and generate responses.
- **Update Logic**: Create the logic to determine when updates are available for clients.

### 7.3. Phase 3: Update Package Management

- **File Storage**: Set up secure storage for update packages.
- **Download Mechanism**: Implement secure endpoints for clients to download update packages.
- **Metadata Handling**: Store and manage metadata for each update.
